somehowe_doneedalicense_nd.thisisfine (v0) (&v1 might not be brought to this world since it never born), you might not believe it but yes it is the license name

before we get cozy: this license doesn’t apply to everyone. it only activates if you’re using this work properly.

“properly” means:
- only on stuff you own, created, or are clearly allowed to touch
- not on paywalled, copyrighted, or otherwise “not yours” material
- not to extract-and-share stuff unless the source explicitly says “sure, go ahead”
- not to build tools or services that depend on ignoring those boundaries
- and, if you do pull something you shouldn’t keep—delete it. all of it. no trace.

if you follow all of that, then:

i give up all rights i can possibly give up. copyright, moral rights, nearby rights, above-and-below rights—gone. no permission needed, no credit expected, no rules from me. use it, change it, break it, commercialize it, turn it into a sticker—whatever.

this work is free. **but only for the lawful.**

because if you misuse it—even once—this license doesn’t just disappear. it self-terminates, and takes more with it:

- you instantly and permanently lose all rights under this license
- you may no longer use, copy, store, share, host, or even keep this work
- you also lose all rights to use, access, distribute, or interact with anything else i’ve ever made, in any form, now or in the future

no workaround. no reinstatement. no “my bad.”

also, i’m not liable for anything. if your use leads to chaos, takedowns, lawsuits, or awkward emails from lawyers—that’s all on you.

so: use responsibly. be legal. be cool. and if you’re not sure whether you’re allowed to use it—don’t.

carry on,
